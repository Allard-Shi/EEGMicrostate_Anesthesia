# EEG microstate analysis in anesthesia
This repository contains relevant codes and implementation of EEG microstate research in propofol-induced anesthesia. The details of method are included in the [paper](https://doi.org/10.1142/S0129065720500057). 

### Data availability
The EEG recordings were freely open-access in [University of Cambridge Data Repository](https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/252736), comprising of pretreated spontaneous EEG and behavioral data from 20 healthy participants (9 male, 11 female; mean age = 30.85; S.D. = 10.98) during propofol-induced transition of anesthesia with ethical approval provided by the Cambridgeshire 2 Regional Ethics Committee. All clinical investigations were conducted in line with the Declaration of Helsinki.

### Requirement (advanced installation)
The toolbox should be loaded before the usage of the codes.

* **Matlab**
* **EEGLAB Toolbox** ([download](https://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/download.php)) 
* **CarTool** ([download](https://sites.google.com/site/cartoolcommunity/))
